# What are they?
The start of any development of a Database starts at the Data Model, which is an abstract model of the real world problem we want to solve.
Depending on the inputs and outputs needed for the problem, the Data Model will influence everything about what Database service we use to how the code will be written.

# What do they aim to solve?
The increasing data production is simply so large that standard technologies that were state of the art before simply cannot keep up. While we are producing more data, the data we're producing is becoming even more interconnected and complex further exacerbating the problem.

There's also a lot of problems that arise when trying to converting from the data stored in the DB to data store in running code, this is know as impedance mismatch.

Impedance Mismatch rundown:
1. **Data Representation Differences:** Object-oriented programming languages organise data in the form of objects, which have attributes and methods. Relational databases, on the other hand, store data in tables with rows and columns. Mapping objects to tables and vice versa can be complex.
    
2. **Complexity in Mapping Relationships:** Object-oriented models allow complex relationships and inheritance hierarchies, which might not directly align with the relational model. Translating these structures to relational database schemas can be challenging.
    
3. **Query Language Mismatch:** Object-oriented languages use methods and object references to access and manipulate data, whereas databases use SQL (Structured Query Language). Bridging the gap between the two often requires translation or adaptation of the queries.
    
4. **Performance Overhead:** Inefficient mappings or translations between the two paradigms can lead to performance issues as they might require extra processing, queries, or transformations.

# Where are we now? 
To fix the aforementioned problem, new database systems were created, the so called "NoSQL" databases (Not only SQL) differ from standard SQL databases because instead of ACID transactions, offer BASE transactions.

BASE is an acronym for:

- Basic Availability:
The system should remain operational and accessible, even if it's not providing the full set of expected services or experiencing partial failures. It prioritizes availability over strong consistency, allowing the system to function and serve requests even in less-than-optimal conditions.
<br>
- Soft-State:
Data within the system can be transient or might change over time. It allows the system to adapt to updates or changes without necessarily requiring absolute consistency at all times. This softness in the state implies that the system does not have to be consistent constantly but tends towards eventual consistency.
<br>
- Eventual consistency:
Given time, the system will reach a consistent state. Even if data updates occur and there might be temporary inconsistencies, the system is designed to converge to a coherent state over time. This doesnâ€™t guarantee immediate consistency but ensures that over a period, the data will become consistent across the system.
