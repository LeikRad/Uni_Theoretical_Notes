# Uni_Theoretical_Notes
Theoretical notes taken with obsidian

# Obsidian
While the files are written in Markdown, using obsidian to read them is highly advised because it adds extra formatting to MD, and things that are written may not display normally without it. (For example \<br/\> are used but will not display in regular MD).

# What is this?
These notes' purpose is to offer a summary version of the slides with more information (where I deem fit) in a more concise manner.

There will be an index in every different subject, with links to the "starting" file of every PDF.

This "starting" file will have an overview of topic, and when applicable, will have links to files that go more in depth with practical examples (I.e Application Type -> Actual Apllications). At the end this file there will also be a link back to the index, a link to the previous and next PDF.

The files with more in depth information will only have a link back to the index and the overview of the topic.
